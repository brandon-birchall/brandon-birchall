# Current Projects


## SnareGAN

### Overview

I learned about deep convolutional GANs and general GAN architectures to attempt to generate Snare Drum sounds. 

### Project Status

The project works and generates interesting sounds which appear to resemble a snare drum moreso than they do noise, however more compute resources and a better understanding of sound/signal processing in the context of AI/GANs is needed to optimize the model to produce better results.

### What I learned

I learned about short-time fourier transforms and how they can be used to better represent a sound in a way in which a neural network can work with. 

I also learned about how GANs work, which is definitely something I plan on learning more about and working on in the future. I think that GANs could be used to improve the quality of images/videos/sounds or even in the far future used to generate them from scratch.


## Raytracer

### Overview

I built a raytracer in Java using OpenGL bindings provided by LWJGL. It runs on the GPU using Compute Shaders.

### Project Status

The project works and can render a scene with reflections, coloured point lights and spheres. There are a few things I would have liked to have added, namely a 
more accurate light model and physically based rendering methods, however I have moved onto other projects now so these may be things for the future.

### What I learned

I had fun working out how to use OpenGL compute shaders to accelerate the ray tracing process. GLSL doesn't allow recursive functions which means that I had to re-think 
how reflections are calculated as this would typically make a recursive function call.

I also learned a lot about computer graphics and how realistic scenes can be drawn by mimicking what light does in the real world. This involves a lot of linear
algebra and vector mathematics which I enjoyed learning in a computer graphics context.
