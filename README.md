# Profile
I'm Brandon Birchall, **machine learning enthusiast** and avid developer. I love all things computer science, but really enjoy machine learning and artificial intelligence.  

I'm also really interested in **computer hardware design, GPU programming, optimization problems and parallel processing**. 

In my spare time I produce electronic music and I'm also a keen freerunner.

# Current Projects

## Raytracer

### Overview

I built a raytracer in Java using OpenGL bindings provided by LWJGL. It runs on the GPU using Compute Shaders.

### Project Status

The project works and can render a scene with reflections, coloured point lights and spheres. There are a few things I would have liked to have added, namely a 
more accurate light model and physically based rendering methods, however I have moved onto other projects now so these may be things for the future.

### What I learned

I had fun working out how to use OpenGL compute shaders to accelerate the ray tracing process. GLSL doesn't allow recursive functions which means that I had to re-think 
how reflections are calculated as this would typically make a recursive function call.

I also learned a lot about computer graphics and how realistic scenes can be drawn by mimicking what light does in the real world. This involves a lot of linear
algebra and vector mathematics which I enjoyed learning in a computer graphics context.
